# Fire-Detection-System-in-python
This system can detect fires on video frames. I have used HSV algorithm to track fires in images and video. This system has three main features such as Detect fire in video frame, Turn on alarm sound, and then, It will send emails to fire engine services.
To run and test this program, open fire_detector.py and type name of video or type 0 for using webcam for testing.
